# Repository status

The repository currently only includes the top-level README and does not contain the application code referenced in the review notes (e.g., backend/app/routers/photos.py, frontend/src/components). Those files are required to address the reported accessibility, performance, and correctness issues. Please ensure the project source tree is added so fixes can be implemented and tested.
